# Multilayer Perceptron

It is a modern day name for a Multilayer feed forward
network. It has atleast 3 nodes with a non linear activation
function. The significant thing to note is that it can
classify non linearly separable data also.

It is a misnomer because the original perceptron used a Heaviside activation
function which is a linear function only

Modern feedforward networks are trained using **backpropogation** and they are
called "vanilla" neural networks
