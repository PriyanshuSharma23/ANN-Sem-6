# Topology in Neural Network

It suggests how neurons are connected in a neural network. It is a key factor in how the network functions and learns.

## Types

## Feed forward network

### 1. Single layer feed forward network

Signal flows only from input to output, all nodes of the current layer are connected to the next layer.

### 2. Multi layer feed forward network

Hidden layers

## Feedback Network

Signal can flow in both directions, which makes this dynamic and non linear. It changes continuously until it reaches equilibrium.

### 1. Fully recurrent

Simplest feedback recurrent network, all nodes are connected to each other

### 2. Jordan network

Forms a closed loop the output will go back to the input layer again.
